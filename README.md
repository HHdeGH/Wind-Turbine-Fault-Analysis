# Wind-Turbine-Fault-Analysis
There are 4 classes of faults arising in the wind turbine due to fault in the bearings. The data acquired is analysed using various machine learning algorithms. Since, it's the case of multi class classification, the data is analysed using Multi class Support Vector Machines (SVM), Discriminant Analysis, Random Forests and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
